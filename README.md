# Calculating Pi with Hadoop

## Overview
This project demonstrates the calculation of Pi using Hadoop's MapReduce framework. 

Despite Hadoop not being ideal for computationally intensive tasks, this project aims to showcase its capabilities through a practical example.

## Usage
Set up an Ubuntu VM on Google Cloud

Install Hadoop and configure the environment

Run the MapReduce program using the provided input files

Calculate Pi using the output from the MapReduce program

## Note
This project is based on a practice question to gain hands-on experience with Hadoop technology.
